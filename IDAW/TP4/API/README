GET /users/{id}: Retrieves a single user by ID.
POST /users: Creates a new user in the database.
DELETE /users: Deletes all users in the database.
DELETE /users/{id}: Deletes a single user by ID.
PUT /users: Updates a user in the database.
Request parameters:

id: The ID of the user to retrieve or delete.
name: The name of the user to create or update.

Response format:

The API returns responses in JSON format, with the following structure:

"status_message": "Success", // error or success message
"data": [] // data returned by the API
}
